# Meal Preferences Fix - Attending Guests Only

## Issue Summary

Meal preferences and dietary restrictions were being counted for **all** guests who submitted RSVPs, including those who responded 'NO' or 'MAYBE'. This would lead to inaccurate meal ordering since only guests who are actually attending need meals.

## Business Impact

**Before Fix:**

- Guest responds 'NO' with beef preference ‚Üí Beef count increased ‚ùå
- Guest responds 'MAYBE' with vegetarian ‚Üí Vegetarian count increased ‚ùå
- Could lead to over-ordering meals for guests who aren't attending
- Wasted budget on unnecessary meals

**After Fix:**

- Only 'YES' responses count toward meal preferences ‚úÖ
- Accurate meal counts for catering orders ‚úÖ
- Dietary restrictions only for attending guests ‚úÖ
- Cost-effective meal planning ‚úÖ

## Root Cause

The `getWeddingStats()` function in `adminService.ts` was counting meal preferences inside the RSVP loop but **outside** the attending check:

```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG - Counts meals for ALL RSVPs
for (const user of usersWithRSVP) {
  const rsvp = user.rsvp;

  // Check attending status
  switch (rsvp.attending) {
    case "YES": totalAttending++; break;
    case "NO": totalNotAttending++; break;
    case "MAYBE": totalMaybe++; break;
  }

  // Count meal preferences (happens regardless of attending status!)
  if (rsvp.guests && rsvp.guests.length > 0) {
    for (const guest of rsvp.guests) {
      const preference = guest.mealPreference || "Not specified";
      mealPreferenceCounts.set(preference, ...);  // ‚ùå Wrong!
    }
  }
}
```

## Fix Implementation

### Backend: adminService.ts

Wrapped meal preference counting inside an explicit `attending === "YES"` check:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Only count meals for attending guests
for (const user of usersWithRSVP) {
  const rsvp = user.rsvp;

  // Check attending status
  switch (rsvp.attending) {
    case "YES": totalAttending++; break;
    case "NO": totalNotAttending++; break;
    case "MAYBE": totalMaybe++; break;
  }

  // ONLY count meal preferences for YES responses
  if (rsvp.attending === "YES") {
    if (rsvp.guests && rsvp.guests.length > 0) {
      for (const guest of rsvp.guests) {
        const preference = guest.mealPreference || "Not specified";
        mealPreferenceCounts.set(preference, ...);  // ‚úÖ Correct!

        if (guest.allergies) {
          dietaryRestrictions.add(guest.allergies);
        }
      }
    } else {
      // Legacy format
      const preference = rsvp.mealPreference || "Not specified";
      mealPreferenceCounts.set(preference, ...);  // ‚úÖ Correct!

      if (rsvp.allergies) {
        dietaryRestrictions.add(rsvp.allergies);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Frontend: Clear Labeling

Updated UI labels to make it explicit that meal counts are for attending guests only:

**AdminStatsCard.tsx:**

```tsx
// Before
<h3>Meal Preferences</h3>

// After
<h3>Meal Preferences (Attending Guests Only)</h3>

// Before
<h3>Dietary Restrictions</h3>

// After
<h3>Dietary Restrictions (Attending Guests Only)</h3>
```

**AdminAnalytics.tsx:**

```tsx
// Before
<h3>Meal Preferences Distribution</h3>

// After
<h3>Meal Preferences Distribution (Attending Guests)</h3>
```

## Example Scenario

**Guest Data:**

1. **Alice Johnson** - Responded: NO, Meal: Beef
2. **Bob Smith** - Responded: YES, Meal: Chicken
3. **Charlie Williams** - Responded: NO, Meal: Vegetarian
4. **Diana Martinez** - Responded: MAYBE, Meal: Fish

**Before Fix (WRONG):**

- Beef: 1 (Alice) ‚ùå
- Chicken: 1 (Bob) ‚úÖ
- Vegetarian: 1 (Charlie) ‚ùå
- Fish: 1 (Diana) ‚ùå
- **Total meals to order: 4** (but only 1 guest attending!)

**After Fix (CORRECT):**

- Chicken: 1 (Bob) ‚úÖ
- **Total meals to order: 1** (accurate!)

## Data Flow

```
Backend (adminService.ts)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> getWeddingStats()
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Filter RSVPs where attending === 'YES'
            ‚îî‚îÄ> Count meal preferences
                 ‚îî‚îÄ> Return stats

Frontend Components
  ‚îú‚îÄ> AdminStatsCard
  ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ> Display meal preferences (from backend stats)
  ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ> Label: "(Attending Guests Only)"
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ> AdminAnalytics
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Display meal distribution chart (from backend stats)
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Label: "(Attending Guests)"
```

## Files Modified

```
‚úÖ server/src/services/adminService.ts
   - Wrapped meal preference counting in attending === 'YES' check
   - Wrapped dietary restriction collection in same check
   - Affects both guest array format and legacy format

‚úÖ client/src/components/admin/AdminStatsCard.tsx
   - Updated "Meal Preferences" ‚Üí "Meal Preferences (Attending Guests Only)"
   - Updated "Dietary Restrictions" ‚Üí "Dietary Restrictions (Attending Guests Only)"

‚úÖ client/src/components/admin/AdminAnalytics.tsx
   - Updated "Meal Preferences Distribution" ‚Üí "Meal Preferences Distribution (Attending Guests)"
```

## Testing Verification

### Test Case 1: Database Check

Run check script to verify current data:

```bash
cd server && node check-stats.cjs
```

Expected output format:

```
Total invited: 4
Has RSVP: 3
Pending: 1

Attendance:
- YES: 1
- NO: 2
- MAYBE: 0
```

### Test Case 2: Stats API Response

Query GraphQL endpoint:

```graphql
query {
  adminGetUserStats {
    totalAttending
    totalRSVPed
    mealPreferences {
      preference
      count
    }
  }
}
```

**Expected behavior:**

- `totalAttending = 1` (Bob Smith)
- `mealPreferences` should only show Bob's meal choice
- Alice and Charlie's meal preferences should NOT appear

### Test Case 3: Admin Dashboard UI

1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Overview
2. Check "Meal Preferences (Attending Guests Only)" section
3. Should only show meals for guests who responded 'YES'
4. Count should match `totalAttending` number

### Test Case 4: Analytics Dashboard

1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Analytics
2. Check "Meal Preferences Distribution (Attending Guests)" chart
3. Pie chart should only include 'YES' responses
4. Percentages should add up to 100% of attending guests

## Edge Cases Handled

### Multiple Guests in One RSVP

```typescript
// If user brings +2 guests, all three meals counted (if attending = YES)
if (rsvp.attending === "YES" && rsvp.guests.length === 3) {
  // Counts all 3 guests' meal preferences ‚úÖ
}
```

### Legacy vs New Format

```typescript
// Works for both formats
if (rsvp.guests && rsvp.guests.length > 0) {
  // New format: guests array ‚úÖ
} else {
  // Legacy format: single meal preference ‚úÖ
}
```

### Missing Meal Preferences

```typescript
const preference = guest.mealPreference || "Not specified";
// Still counted even if not specified ‚úÖ
```

### Dietary Restrictions

```typescript
// Also only counted for attending guests
if (rsvp.attending === "YES") {
  if (guest.allergies) {
    dietaryRestrictions.add(guest.allergies); ‚úÖ
  }
}
```

## Impact Analysis

### Components Affected

‚úÖ **AdminStatsCard** - Displays updated meal counts  
‚úÖ **AdminAnalytics** - Charts show correct distributions  
‚úÖ **AdminGuestExport** - No change (exports all RSVPs)  
‚úÖ **AdminEmailReminders** - No change (not meal-related)

### APIs Affected

‚úÖ **adminGetUserStats Query** - Returns filtered meal preferences  
‚ùå **adminGetAllRSVPs Query** - No change (returns all data)  
‚ùå **RSVP Mutations** - No change (save all data)

### Database Impact

‚ùå **No database changes** - All RSVP data still saved  
‚úÖ **Only calculation logic changed** - Filtering happens at query time

## Build Status

‚úÖ **Server build successful** - No TypeScript errors

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Meal Preference Changes**

   - Track if guest changes from YES ‚Üí NO
   - Show historical meal preferences for reporting

2. **MAYBE Response Handling**

   - Optional toggle: "Include MAYBE guests in meal count?"
   - Configurable safety margin for catering

3. **Export Clarification**

   - CSV export could have separate columns:
     - "All Meal Preferences" (current)
     - "Attending Meal Preferences Only" (new)

4. **Analytics Insights**
   - Show breakdown: "X meals ordered vs Y total responses"
   - Calculate cost savings from excluding NO/MAYBE

## Lessons Learned

### Data Filtering Best Practices

1. **Filter at calculation time**, not storage time

   - Store all data (YES, NO, MAYBE responses)
   - Filter when calculating business metrics
   - Allows for flexible reporting later

2. **Make filtering explicit in UI**

   - Label sections clearly: "(Attending Guests Only)"
   - Users understand what numbers mean
   - Reduces confusion and support requests

3. **Consistent filtering across components**

   - Backend does the filtering once
   - All frontend components use same data
   - Single source of truth

4. **Consider business logic implications**
   - Ask: "What does this number need to represent?"
   - Meal preferences = catering order = attending only
   - RSVP statistics = all responses = everyone
