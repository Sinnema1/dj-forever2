# Analytics Dashboard Validation Guide

**Quick Reference for Production Analytics Testing**

## 🎯 Pre-Validation Checklist

- [ ] Login to admin dashboard: https://www.djforever2026.com/admin
- [ ] Navigate to "Analytics" tab
- [ ] Have database access ready for cross-verification (optional)
- [ ] Browser DevTools open (Console + Network tabs)

---

## 📊 Visual Components to Validate

### 1. Key Insights Cards (Top Section)

**Expected Cards** (3-5 insights based on data):

- ✅ "Strong RSVP rate! X% of guests have responded"
- ✅ "Dietary Restrictions: X guests have special needs"
- ✅ "Popular Meal Choice: [Meal] is most popular with X selections"

**Validation Steps**:

```
1. Count insight cards displayed
2. Verify icons (✓ success, ⚠️ warning, ℹ️ info)
3. Check messages are descriptive and accurate
4. No generic/placeholder text
```

### 2. Response Timeline Chart

**Visual Check**:

- X-axis: Dates (MM/DD/YYYY format)
- Y-axis: Response counts (0 to max)
- Bars: Stacked colors (green=attending, yellow=maybe, red=not attending)
- Legend: Clear labels with color indicators

**Data Validation**:

```javascript
// Expected pattern: Cumulative growth over time
// Bars should never decrease (cumulative totals)
// Total height = all responses to date
```

**Cross-check**:

- Total responses at latest date = Total RSVPed in Overview tab
- No negative values
- Dates in chronological order

### 3. Meal Preferences Pie Chart

**Critical**: This chart should ONLY show **attending guests** (not NO/MAYBE responses)

**Visual Check**:

- Pie chart segments proportional to meal counts
- Breakdown list below chart
- Percentages sum to ~100%
- Each meal shows: Name, Count, Percentage

**Common Meals**:

- Beef
- Chicken
- Vegetarian
- Vegan
- Fish/Seafood
- Kids Meal

**Validation Formula**:

```
Total Meal Count = Count of guests with rsvp.attending === 'YES'
Percentage = (Meal Count / Total Meal Count) × 100
```

**Red Flag**: If meal count > total attending count → BUG

### 4. Party Size Distribution

**Expected Pattern**:

- 1 guest: X parties
- 2 guests: Y parties (typically highest)
- 3 guests: Z parties
- 4+ guests: Few parties

**Validation**:

```
Sum of all parties = Total number of RSVPs submitted
Largest party size should be ≤ Maximum allowed (typically 4-6)
```

### 5. Day of Week Analysis

**Visual Check**:

- 7 bars (Mon-Sun)
- Bar heights show response activity
- Friday/Saturday/Sunday typically highest (weekend responses)

**Data Check**:

```
Total of all days = Total RSVPs submitted
No bars with negative heights
```

### 6. Summary Statistics Grid (Bottom Section)

**4 Key Metrics**:

1. **Total Attending**: Count of rsvp.attending === 'YES'
2. **Attendance Rate**: (Attending / Total RSVPed) × 100%
3. **Pending RSVPs**: isInvited=true AND hasRSVPed=false
4. **Maybe Responses**: Count of rsvp.attending === 'MAYBE'

**Cross-Validation Table**:

| Metric          | Analytics Tab | Overview Tab     | Match? |
| --------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| Total Invited   | N/A           | **\_**           | -      |
| Total RSVPed    | N/A           | **\_**           | -      |
| Total Attending | **\_**        | **\_**           | ✅/❌  |
| Attendance Rate | **\_**%       | **\_**%          | ✅/❌  |
| Pending RSVPs   | **\_**        | Invited - RSVPed | ✅/❌  |
| Maybe Count     | **\_**        | **\_**           | ✅/❌  |

---

## ✅ Validation Workflow

### Step 1: Record Overview Tab Stats (Baseline)

```
Total Invited: _____
Total RSVPed: _____
Total Attending: _____
Total Not Attending: _____
Total Maybe: _____
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Analytics Tab

- Click "Analytics" tab
- Wait for all charts to render (should be < 3 seconds)
- Check for console errors (none expected)

### Step 3: Validate Each Section

Use checklist above for each visual component

### Step 4: Time Range Testing

- Click "Last 7 Days" → verify chart updates
- Click "Last 30 Days" → verify chart updates
- Click "All Time" → verify chart shows complete data
- Ensure filters work without errors

### Step 5: Performance Check

```
Dashboard load time: _____ seconds (target: < 3s)
Analytics tab switch: _____ ms (target: < 500ms)
Time range filter: _____ ms (target: < 200ms)
Any console errors: Yes / No
Any visual glitches: Yes / No
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Meal count > Attending count

**Cause**: Including MAYBE/NO responses in meal calculations  
**Fix**: Filter to only `rsvp.attending === 'YES'` before counting meals  
**Location**: `AdminAnalytics.tsx` line ~60

### Issue: Negative values in charts

**Cause**: Missing null checks or incorrect cumulative logic  
**Fix**: Add default values and validate data before rendering

### Issue: Charts not rendering

**Cause**: Missing data, GraphQL error, or CSS issue  
**Check**: Browser console, Network tab, validate GraphQL response

### Issue: Percentages don't sum to 100%

**Cause**: Rounding errors or missing data  
**Expected**: Should be within ±0.5% due to rounding
