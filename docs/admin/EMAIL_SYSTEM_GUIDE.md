# Email Reminder System - Complete Guide

## Overview

The email reminder system allows admins to send RSVP reminders to guests who haven't responded yet. The system automatically detects whether SMTP is configured and switches between:

- **Console Mode**: Logs emails to console (development/testing)
- **SMTP Mode**: Actually sends emails via your email provider (production)

## Features

âœ… **Flexible Sending Options**

- Send to individual guests
- Send to selected guests (bulk)
- Send to all pending RSVPs

âœ… **Beautiful Email Templates**

- Branded HTML emails with inline styling
- Plain text fallback for compatibility
- QR code login links for easy access

âœ… **Smart Configuration**

- Automatic mode detection (console vs SMTP)
- Zero configuration for development testing
- Easy production setup with environment variables

âœ… **Admin Dashboard Integration**

- Visual pending guest list
- Checkbox selection for bulk operations
- Results modal with success/failure breakdown

## Quick Start

### Development Mode (Console Logging)

No configuration needed! The system automatically logs emails to the console:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then in the admin dashboard:

1. Go to "Email Reminders" tab
2. Click "Send to All Pending" or select specific guests
3. Check your terminal to see the email content

### Production Mode (Actual Email Sending)

#### Step 1: Get Gmail App Password

If using Gmail:

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Go to "App passwords"
4. Generate password for "Mail"
5. Copy the 16-character password

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file in the `server` directory:

```bash
# SMTP Configuration (replace with your actual values)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-actual-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
```

**Important**: Replace the placeholder values:

- `your-email@gmail.com` â†’ Your actual Gmail address
- `your-app-password` â†’ The 16-character app password from Step 1

#### Step 3: Restart Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The system will automatically detect SMTP configuration and switch to SMTP mode!

#### Step 4: Test Email Sending

1. Go to admin dashboard â†’ "Email Reminders" tab
2. Send a test email to yourself first
3. Check your inbox (may take a few seconds)
4. If successful, proceed with bulk sending

## Email Providers

### Gmail (Recommended for Testing)

```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587

```

### Outlook/Hotmail

```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com

## Troubleshooting

### "No pending RSVPs found"

- This means all invited guests have already submitted their RSVPs
- Check the "Guest Management" tab to see RSVP statuses

### Emails not sending (SMTP mode)

1. **Check environment variables**: Ensure all SMTP\_ variables are set correctly
2. **Verify credentials**: Test login to your email provider manually
3. **Check logs**: Look for error messages in the server console
4. **Gmail issues**: Make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled and you're using an App Password (not your regular password)
5. **Port blocked**: Try port 465 instead of 587

### Emails going to spam

- Add a proper "from" email address
- Consider using a dedicated email service (SendGrid, Mailgun)
- Add SPF/DKIM records to your domain (production only)

### Rate limiting

- The system adds 100ms delay between emails to prevent rate limiting
- For large batches, consider using a professional email service

## Technical Details

### Architecture

```
Client (React)
  â””â”€> GraphQL Mutations
       â””â”€> Server Resolvers
            â””â”€> Email Service
                 â”œâ”€> Console Mode (development)
                 â””â”€> SMTP Mode (production)
```

### GraphQL Mutations

```graphql
# Send to single guest
mutation AdminSendReminderEmail($userId: ID!) {
  adminSendReminderEmail(userId: $userId) {
    success
    email
    error
  }
}

# Send to multiple guests
mutation AdminSendBulkReminderEmails($userIds: [ID!]!) {
  adminSendBulkReminderEmails(userIds: $userIds) {
    totalSent
    successCount
    failureCount
    results {
      success
      email
      error
    }
  }
}

# Send to all pending
mutation AdminSendReminderToAllPending {
  adminSendReminderToAllPending {
    totalSent
    successCount
    failureCount
    results {
      success
      email
      error
    }
  }
}
```

### Files

- **Backend Service**: `server/src/services/emailService.ts`
- **GraphQL Schema**: `server/src/graphql/typeDefs.ts`
- **Resolvers**: `server/src/graphql/resolvers.ts`
- **Frontend Component**: `client/src/components/admin/AdminEmailReminders.tsx`
- **Queries**: `client/src/api/adminQueries.ts`

## Security

âœ… **Admin-Only Access**

- All email mutations require admin authentication
- Non-admin users cannot access email functionality

âœ… **Safe Environment Variables**

- Email credentials stored in `.env` (never committed to git)
- Automatic filtering of placeholder values

âœ… **Rate Limiting Protection**

- 100ms delay between bulk emails
- Sequential sending to avoid provider blocks

âœ… **Error Handling**

- Failed emails don't stop the batch
- Detailed error reporting for troubleshooting

## Best Practices

### Development

- Use console mode for testing email templates
- Verify email content before configuring SMTP
- Test with your own email first

### Production

- Use a dedicated email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
- Set up proper SPF/DKIM records
- Monitor delivery rates and spam reports
- Send test emails to yourself periodically

### Email Etiquette

- Don't spam guests - use email reminders sparingly
- Give guests time to respond between reminders
- Personalize when possible
- Always provide an easy way to contact you with questions

## Future Enhancements

Possible future features:

- [ ] Email scheduling (send at specific time)
- [ ] Email templates customization in admin UI
- [ ] Delivery tracking and analytics
- [ ] Bounce and unsubscribe handling
- [ ] Email preview before sending
