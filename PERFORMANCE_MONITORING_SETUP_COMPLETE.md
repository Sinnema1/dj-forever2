  - Real-time tracking of CLS, INP, FCP, LCP, TTFB
  - Performance threshold monitoring with alerts
  - Resource timing analysis
  - Navigation timing metrics
  - Integration with analytics system
  - Network connection detection

### 4. React Integration Components

- **File**: `client/src/components/PerformanceMonitor.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - React component for performance monitoring
  - `usePerformanceTracking` hook for manual metrics
  - `withPerformanceTracking` HOC for component performance
  - Development mode debugging support

### 5. CI/CD Performance Pipeline

- **File**: `scripts/performance-ci.sh`
- **Features**:
  - Automated performance testing pipeline
  - Bundle regression detection
  - Lighthouse CI integration support
  - Performance report generation
  - GitHub Actions workflow template
  - Artifact preparation for CI systems

## ðŸ“Š Performance Budget Status

Current bundle analysis shows **excellent performance**:

```
âœ… Total Bundle Size: 467.45 KB (within 500 KB budget)
âœ… Apollo GraphQL: 191.70 KB (within 200 KB budget)
âœ… React/Vendor: 138.13 KB (within 300 KB budget)
âœ… App Bundle: 104.32 KB (within budget)
âœ… UI Components: 20.61 KB (within 100 KB budget)
```

## ðŸ”§ Available Commands

### Development

```bash
# Build with bundle analysis
npm run build:analyze

# View bundle visualization
npm run analyze

# Check performance budgets
npm run performance:check

# Full performance build
npm run performance:build
```

### CI/CD Integration

```bash
# Run complete performance pipeline
npm run performance:ci

# Individual pipeline steps available in scripts/performance-ci.sh
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Core Web Vitals Integration

The performance monitoring system automatically tracks:

- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: â‰¤ 0.1 (good)
- **INP (Interaction to Next Paint)**: â‰¤ 200ms (good)
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: â‰¤ 2.5s (good)
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint)**: â‰¤ 1.8s (good)
- **TTFB (Time to First Byte)**: â‰¤ 800ms (good)

### Real User Monitoring

- Automatic performance data collection
- Analytics integration for production insights
- Performance issue alerting
- Resource timing analysis
- Network condition detection

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

### Bundle Analysis Enhancement

- **Dual Templates**: Both treemap and sunburst visualizations
- **Environment Control**: `ANALYZE=true` triggers analysis
- **Chunk Strategy**: Optimized manual chunks for better splitting
- **Performance Integration**: Built into standard build process

### Performance Budget System

- **Comprehensive Budgets**: Total and per-chunk limits
- **Detailed Reporting**: Size breakdown and recommendations
- **CI/CD Ready**: Exit codes and JSON reports
- **Visual Feedback**: Colored console output

### Core Web Vitals Service

- **Modern API**: Uses web-vitals v5 with INP (replaces FID)
- **Real-time Tracking**: Immediate performance data collection
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Automatic alerts for poor performance
- **Production Ready**: Analytics integration and error handling

### React Integration

- **App-level Monitoring**: Integrated into main App component
- **Component Hooks**: `usePerformanceTracking` for manual metrics
- **HOC Pattern**: `withPerformanceTracking` for component monitoring
- **Development Tools**: Debug mode with performance summaries

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Automated Testing**: Complete performance validation
- **Regression Detection**: Bundle size and performance alerts
- **Report Generation**: Comprehensive markdown reports
- **GitHub Actions**: Ready-to-use workflow template
- **Lighthouse Integration**: Optional Lighthouse CI support

## ðŸ”„ Integration Points

### Main Application

- **App.tsx**: PerformanceMonitor component integrated
- **Service Worker**: Enhanced caching with performance insights
- **Build Process**: Performance analysis in production builds

### Development Workflow

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries
- **Debug Mode**: Development-only performance logging
