# DJ Forever 2 Wedding Website

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   cd client && npm install
   ```

2. **Seed the database:**

   For production:

   ```sh
   cd server
   npm run clean:db
   npm run seed-prod
   ```

   For testing:

   ```sh
   cd server
   npm run clean:db
   npm run seed-test
   ```

   > **Best Practice:** For backend tests, manual seeding is not required. The test runner will automatically clean and isolate the test database before each run, and each test creates its own data.
   > All scripts accept the `MONGODB_DB_NAME` environment variable. Example:
   >
   > ```sh
   > MONGODB_DB_NAME=djforever2_test npm run print:users
   > MONGODB_DB_NAME=djforever2 npm run print:users
   > ```

3. **Generate QR codes:**

   ```sh
   npm run generate:qrcodes
   ```

   QR codes will be saved in `server/qr-codes/`.

4. **Build and run the app:**

   ```sh
   cd client && npm run build
   cd ../server && npm run start
   ```

## Testing

- **Run backend tests:**

  ```sh
  cd server
  npm run test
  ```

  - Tests use a separate database (`djforever2_test`) and automatically clean it before each run.
  - The test environment uses `.env.test` for configuration. Example:

    ```env
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
    MONGODB_DB_NAME=djforever2_test
    JWT_SECRET=your-test-secret
    ```

- **Frontend testing:**

  ```sh
  cd client
  npm run test
  ```

## QR Code-Only Guest Login

All authentication is handled by scanning your invitation QR code:

- Each guest receives a physical "save the date" with a unique QR code.
- Scanning the QR code directs you to a URL like:
  `https://dj-forever2.onrender.com/login/qr/<qrToken>`
- You are automatically logged in‚Äîno password, registration, or manual login required.
- The site will show personalized content and RSVP options for your invitation.

**Note:** There is no login button on the website. If you are not logged in, scan your invitation QR code again to access your account.

## Performance Monitoring

The website includes comprehensive performance monitoring and optimization features:

### Bundle Analysis

```sh
# Build with detailed bundle analysis
npm run build:analyze

# View interactive bundle visualization
npm run analyze
```

### Performance Budget Checking

```sh
# Check if bundle meets performance budgets
npm run performance:check

# Full performance build with analysis
npm run performance:build
```

### CI/CD Performance Pipeline

```sh
# Run complete performance testing pipeline
npm run performance:ci
```

### Core Web Vitals Tracking

The app automatically tracks real user performance metrics:

- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: ‚â§ 0.1 (good)
- **INP (Interaction to Next Paint)**: ‚â§ 200ms (good)
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: ‚â§ 2.5s (good)
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint)**: ‚â§ 1.8s (good)
- **TTFB (Time to First Byte)**: ‚â§ 800ms (good)

**Current Performance Status**: ‚úÖ **All budgets passing** (467KB total bundle, well within 500KB limit)

### Performance Reports

After running performance commands, reports are generated in:

- `performance-reports/` - CI/CD pipeline reports
- `dist/stats.html` - Interactive bundle visualization
- `dist/performance-report.json` - Detailed performance data
