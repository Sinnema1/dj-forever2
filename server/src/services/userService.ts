/**
 * @fileoverview User Service for DJ Forever 2 Wedding Website
 * @module services/userService
 * @version 1.0.0
 *
 * Placeholder service for comprehensive user management operations.
 * Currently minimal as user operations are primarily handled through
 * authentication service and direct model usage in GraphQL resolvers.
 *
 * Future Implementation Plans:
 * - User profile CRUD operations
 * - Bulk user management for wedding party administration
 * - User invitation status management
 * - User search and filtering operations
 * - User statistics and reporting
 * - Advanced user relationship management (guest groups, families)
 *
 * Current Architecture:
 * - User authentication handled by authService.ts
 * - User model operations primarily in GraphQL resolvers
 * - Direct User model usage for simple queries
 * - QR token management integrated with authentication flow
 *
 * Integration Points:
 * - Authentication service for user login/registration
 * - RSVP service for user invitation status updates
 * - GraphQL resolvers for user profile queries
 * - Database seeding scripts for user creation
 *
 * @example
 * // Future implementation example:
 * // export async function getUserProfile(userId: string): Promise<IUser>
 * // export async function updateUserProfile(userId: string, updates: Partial<IUser>): Promise<IUser>
 * // export async function searchUsers(query: string): Promise<IUser[]>
 *
 * @todo Implement comprehensive user CRUD operations
 * @todo Add user bulk management operations
 * @todo Add user statistics and reporting functions
 * @todo Implement user invitation management workflows
 *
 * @dependencies
 * - Future: ../models/User for database operations
 * - Future: ../utils/validation for input validation
 * - Future: ../utils/errors for error handling
